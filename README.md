This repository contains a C program for calculating training weights and rep-set goals for the "5/3/1 Wendler" strength training program. The 5/3/1 program, developed by Jim Wendler, is designed to help individuals make consistent strength gains in the major compound lifts, including the Military Press, Deadlift, Bench Press, and Squat.

The program allows for several command-line options:

-s, -b, -o, -d: Set the 1RM values for squat, bench press, overhead press, and deadlift, respectively.
-w: Specify the week number (1 to 4) to display weights for.
-k: Enable kilograms display (by default, it displays weights in pounds).
